# GAN-MNIST-PyTorch
Testing training a GAN to generate new digits from MNIST dataset, using PyTorch library.

Repository made for personal studying purpose, I do not guarantee this code to be working in the future.

Kudos to https://medium.com/@simple.schwarz/how-to-build-a-gan-for-generating-mnist-digits-in-pytorch-b9bf71269da8, from whom I took inspiration
